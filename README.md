## Autonomous parking with Smartcar

### What is our idea?

Our main idea for this project is a smartcar that is capable of autonomous parking in an empty spot when given a command to do so. We are directing our focus on **automatic parking functionality**, but will also see if there is enough time for additional functionalities to be implemented, namely - making manual controls for the car, autonomous parking specialization (for different cases).



### How are we going to do this?
Car will stay idle till it is interacted with. In order to relay the command to park, along with a few other commands (**turn On/Off**, **start moving**, **stop** etc. and **manual controls** if there is time), we are going to create **UI** for the car - a simple **mobile app** which uses bluetooth connection to communicate with the car. After receiving a command, smartcar will change its movement accordingly to correspond to it. Smartcar at the same time will include obstacle avoidance capabilities to **avoid collision** while on autonomous movement (i.e. detecting obstacles in its way as well as on the car's sides in order to park without hitting anything).

### Why?
Goal of this idea is intended for comfortability of the customer and efficiency in performing common everyday task with just a few buttons pressed on your smartphone. Autonomous parking aids safety purposes as well. We want to reduce the amount of accidents the cars are involved in and increase its obstacle detection in order to avoid obstacles in a smarter way.

### Components we are going to use:
  - Smartcar shield
  - Gyroscope
  - Speed encoders
  - Bluetooth platform
  - Ultrasonic sensors
